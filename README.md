# Simple Augmented Reality App

## Warning: this project cannot be compiled anymore!
This Unity project was not intended to be version-tracked which explains the simple file hierarchy. Only non unity-generated files were kept, after the project was over. '/unity-files' folder contains unorganized Unity files and C# scripts.\
This project used to work a long time ago (november 2017) with Unity alongside ARToolKit Plugin. Unfortunately ARToolKit Plugin is not usable any longer with the free Unity licenses.  It is likely that the source files can still be used with Unity Pro license and a bit of time to wire them up.

## The compiled Android APK
The Android APK was compiled in november 2017. The compilation was performed with Unity for Android.\
If you trust ar-photo-visu.apk (not recommended by any security policy!), feel free to install it on your android phone.

## What is inside the app?
This is an Augmented Reality app which displays photos in real size on one's environment. To make the Augmented Reality work, one should first print a marker (see AR-marker.pdf) on paper. The user can load, display and rotate the photos.\
How are the photo loaded? Those are loaded from a heroku-hosted website. You can find some more information about this website here: https://github.com/loisfa/website-photos.
